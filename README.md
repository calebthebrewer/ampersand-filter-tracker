AmpersandFilterTracker
==================
Creates both a GUI and a filter from multiple models.

## Features
* Combines multiple filters into one filter you can use on ampersand-subcollections.
* Pretty list with cancel buttons to clear entire filters.
* Pass custom values for a cleared filter, or a function to test for clearance.
* If your models are properly binded, it will force triggers.
* Changes in your models' states will also update the filter tracker.
* Custom output for the list.

## Installation
`npm install ampersand-filter-tracker`

## Documentation
Documentation will be added soon.
